                  The maximum number of JEE (Advanced) attempts has been limited
                  by IITs. There are now just two opportunities for students:
                  one right after the XII board examinations and the second
                  immediately in the following year. They should aim to pass the
                  JEE (Advanced) on their first attempt and should not put
                  themselves under undue pressure because appearing for the
                  second and final attempts could be too risky due to the
                  possibility of illness or accidents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More than 18 lakh students take the NEET exam each year, one
                  of the most difficult medical entrance tests in the nation.
                  According to the number of NEET 2019 applications, 15.19 lakh
                  candidates are anticipated to take the exam to be enrolled on
                  MBBS and BDS universities across the nation.

                  Up until the 1990s, it was acceptable to begin your
                  preparation after grade XI and at the start of grade XII, but
                  even then, you had to start early enough to achieve Top Ranks.
                  But beginning in the early 2000s, it became customary to begin
                  JEE preparation at the start of class XI and commit at least
                  two years to intense preparation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, only the talented students can succeed by beginning their
                  JEE training in XI due to the increased competition and the
                  fact that there are only two chances available. However, if
                  you lack the natural talent that would lead you to the top
                  ranks of JEE, you will have no choice but to begin your
                  preparation in class IX.
